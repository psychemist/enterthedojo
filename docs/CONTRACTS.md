## Deployment

### Prerequisites

- Starknet wallet with testnet ETH
- Scarb 2.8.0+
- Starkli for deployment

### Build

```bash
cd contracts
scarb build
```

### Deploy

```bash
# Declare the contract
starkli declare target/dev/game_marketplace_GameMarketplace.contract_class.json \
  --account ~/.starkli-wallets/account.json \
  --rpc https://starknet-sepolia.public.blastapi.io

# Deploy marketplace
starkli deploy <MARKETPLACE_CLASS_HASH> <OWNER_ADDRESS> \
  --account ~/.starkli-wallets/account.json

# Deploy registry
starkli deploy <REGISTRY_CLASS_HASH> <OWNER_ADDRESS> \
  --account ~/.starkli-wallets/account.json
```

## Integration Notes

### Bitcoin Payment Flow

1. User selects asset and price is quoted in BTC
2. User initiates Atomiq swap (BTC â†’ STRK)
3. Atomiq returns swap_proof upon completion
4. User calls `buy_asset()` with swap_proof
5. Contract verifies proof and transfers asset

### Game Integration

1. Game developer registers game via `register_game()`
2. Admin verifies game via `verify_game()`
3. Players can list assets from verified games
4. Marketplace queries game contract for ownership verification

## Security Considerations

1. **Access Control**: Only sellers can cancel/update their listings
2. **Payment Verification**: swap_proof must be validated before transfer
3. **Ownership Check**: Game contract should verify seller owns asset
4. **Reentrancy**: Consider adding reentrancy guards for future versions
5. **Emergency Pause**: Consider adding pause functionality

## Testing

```bash
cd contracts
scarb test
```
